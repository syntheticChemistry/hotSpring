## What This Study Is

hotSpring is a computational physics biome within ecoPrimals. It replicates
published work from the Murillo Group (Michigan State University) on consumer
hardware, then re-executes the computations using BarraCuda — a pure Rust
scientific computing library. ToadStool/barracuda is the shared fungus: hotSpring
leans on it for GPU device management and shader dispatch, evolves new shaders and
physics systems locally, and hands them off for upstream absorption. Other springs
(neuralSpring, desertSpring) follow the same pattern independently — they don't
import hotSpring, but can review its code in `ecoPrimals/` and learn from it.

The study answers five questions:
1. **Can published computational science be independently reproduced?** (Answer: yes, but it required fixing 6 silent bugs and rebuilding physics that was behind a gated platform)
2. **Can Rust + WebGPU replace the Python scientific stack for real physics?** (Answer: yes — BarraCuda achieves 478× faster throughput and 44.8× less energy at L1, with GPU FP64 validated to 4.55e-13 MeV precision. Full Sarkas Yukawa MD runs on a $600 consumer GPU: 9/9 PP cases pass at N=10,000 with 80,000 production steps in 3.66 hours for $0.044. GPU-resident CG reduces readback by 15,360× and speeds dynamical fermion HMC by 30.7×. Bidirectional streaming pipeline dispatches 90%+ to GPU with async readback.)
3. **Can consumer GPUs do first-principles nuclear structure at scale?** (Answer: yes — the full AME2020 dataset (2,042 nuclei, 39x the published paper) runs on a single RTX 4070. L1 Pareto analysis, L2 GPU-batched HFB, and L3 deformed HFB all produce results. This is direct physics computation, not surrogate learning.)
4. **Does the Python → Rust → GPU evolution path extend beyond plasma physics?** (Answer: yes — lattice QCD (SU(3) pure gauge, HMC, staggered Dirac, dynamical fermion pseudofermion HMC), Abelian Higgs (U(1) gauge + Higgs field, 143× faster than Python), transport coefficients (Green-Kubo, Stanton-Murillo), screened Coulomb (Sturm eigensolve, 2274× faster than Python), and HotQCD EOS tables are all validated on CPU with WGSL templates ready for GPU promotion. 22 papers reproduced, 400+ validation checks, ~$0.20 total compute cost.)
5. **Can physics math be truly substrate-portable — CPU → GPU → NPU?** (Answer: yes — ESN reservoir math validated across f64 CPU, f32 NpuSimulator, int4 quantized, and real AKD1000 NPU hardware. 10 SDK assumptions overturned by probing beyond the SDK. The same WGSL shader math trains on GPU and deploys on NPU for inference at 30mW. See `metalForge/npu/akida/BEYOND_SDK.md`.)

## Bazavov Extension: Lattice QCD on Consumer Hardware

hotSpring has extended from plasma physics to lattice gauge theory. The
Bazavov connection (CMSE & Physics, MSU) provides the bridge: both Murillo
and Bazavov study strongly coupled many-body systems with overlapping
computational methods (MD ↔ HMC, plasma EOS ↔ QCD EOS).

### Remaining Gaps for Full Lattice QCD

| Gap | Needed For | Priority | Status |
|-----|-----------|----------|--------|
| ~~FFT (momentum-space)~~ | Full QCD with dynamical fermions | — | ✅ **Done** — toadstool `Fft1DF64`+`Fft3DF64` (14 GPU tests, 1e-10) |
| ~~GPU SU(3) plaquette shader~~ | GPU-accelerated HMC | — | ✅ **Done** — `wilson_plaquette_f64.wgsl` |
| ~~GPU HMC force + Abelian Higgs~~ | GPU-accelerated gauge evolution | — | ✅ **Done** — `su3_hmc_force_f64.wgsl` + `higgs_u1_hmc_f64.wgsl` |

| ~~Larger lattice sizes (8^4, 16^4)~~ | ~~Physical results~~ | — | ✅ **Done** — 4⁴-16⁴ streaming validated, 67× CPU at 16⁴. RTX 3090 enables 48⁴ |
| ~~Production beta-scan (32⁴)~~ | ~~Phase transition resolution~~ | — | ✅ **Done** — 12-point 32⁴ scan, 13.6h, χ=40.1 at β=5.69 matches β_c=5.692 |
| DF64 hybrid core streaming | 6.7× HMC speedup on consumer GPUs | 🔴 Next | `df64_core.wgsl` validated; HMC kernels not yet rewired |

### Production β-Scan Results (Feb 24, 2026)

The RTX 3090 completed a 12-point quenched SU(3) β-scan on a 32⁴ lattice (1M sites,
200 measurements/point, 3,000 HMC trajectories) in 13.6 hours for $0.58 of electricity.
The susceptibility peak χ=40.1 at β=5.69 matches the known critical coupling
β_c=5.692 to three significant figures — **deconfinement phase transition resolved**.
Finite-size scaling confirmed: 16⁴ (Titan V NVK, χ~1.0) vs 32⁴ (3090, χ=40-53).
This used only 1.6% of the 3090's chip (native f64). DF64 hybrid would reduce the
same run to ~2 hours. See `experiments/013_BIOMEGATE_PRODUCTION_BETA_SCAN.md`.

### Heterogeneous Hardware Pipeline: Lattice QCD Phase Structure

GPU FFT f64 is available (toadstool Session 25). The full GPU lattice QCD stack
is complete — Dirac SpMV (8/8), CG solver (9/9), and pseudofermion HMC (7/7)
are all validated. The **deconfinement phase transition** — the most
important observable in finite-temperature QCD — is now resolved on a 32⁴ lattice
using position-space quantities: the Polyakov loop ⟨|L|⟩ and plaquette ⟨P⟩.

**Pipeline**: GPU generates pure-gauge SU(3) configurations via HMC → NPU
classifies phases in real-time from (β, ⟨P⟩, ⟨|L|⟩) features → CPU validates
against known β_c ≈ 5.69. The NPU learns the mapping from gauge observables
to phase label (confined/deconfined) at negligible cost.

This heterogeneous approach makes lattice gauge theory phase structure accessible
on consumer hardware today — no FFT, no HPC, just GPU+NPU+CPU for ~$900 total.

**Validated**: `validate_lattice_npu` detects β_c = 5.715 (known 5.692, error 0.4%)
from real SU(3) HMC observables. ESN classifier achieves 100% test accuracy.
NpuSimulator f32 parity: max error 2.8e-7. 10/10 checks pass.

### What Was Previously Impossible — Now Demonstrated

`validate_hetero_monitor` (9/9 checks) proves five capabilities that were
literally impossible before the heterogeneous GPU+NPU+CPU pipeline:

| Capability | Before | Now | Measured |
|------------|--------|-----|----------|
| Live phase monitoring during HMC | Offline analysis only | ESN classifies each config as GPU generates it | 9.1 μs per prediction |
| Continuous transport prediction | Green-Kubo requires full trajectory | NPU predicts D*/η*/λ* from 10-frame window | Multi-output, all finite |
| Cross-substrate parity | Physics locked to one substrate | Same weights: CPU f64, f32 sim, int4 quantized | f32 error 5.1e-7, int4 error 0.13 |
| Zero-overhead monitoring | Monitoring paused simulation | Prediction takes 0.09% of HMC time | 9 μs vs 10.3 ms |
| Predictive steering | Uniform sampling wastes compute | ESN oracle focuses compute near phase boundary | 62% fewer evaluations, β_c error 0.013 |

### R. Anderson Extension: Hot Spring Microbial Evolution (Taq Corollary)

Rika Anderson (Carleton College) studies microbial evolution in extreme environments.
Her lab has published population genomics of *Sulfolobus islandicus* in the **same
Yellowstone hot springs** where *Thermus aquaticus* was discovered — the organism
whose Taq polymerase enabled PCR and anchors the constrained evolution thesis
(`gen3/CONSTRAINED_EVOLUTION_FORMAL.md` §1.1).

Campbell, Anderson et al. (2017) showed that geographic isolation between hot springs
drives structured genomic variation, with different populations showing different
susceptibilities to mobile genetic elements. This is constrained evolution in nature:
thermal constraint selects for survival, geographic isolation creates independent
evolutionary trajectories, and mobile elements provide material for innovation.

Anderson's 2021 mSystems paper explicitly cites Lenski's LTEE (§1.2 of the constrained
evolution thesis) and formalizes when stochastic forces dominate over deterministic
selection in extreme environments — introducing Muller's ratchet as a consequence
of extreme energy limitation.

**Papers queued**: See `specs/PAPER_REVIEW_QUEUE.md` — Papers 23-24 (Campbell 2017,
Anderson 2021). Reproduction of Paper 23 requires bioinformatics only (public
*Sulfolobus* genomes) — wetSpring's sovereign pipeline handles the computation.

## metalForge: Hardware Beyond the SDK

hotSpring's metalForge initiative characterizes actual hardware behavior versus
vendor documentation. The same methodology that confirmed Titan V (GV100) native
f64 at 1:2 via NVK and measured consumer Ampere/Ada fp64 at ~1:64 (matching CUDA
hardware, correcting an earlier overestimate) was applied to the BrainChip AKD1000 NPU.

### NPU Beyond-SDK Discoveries (10 SDK assumptions overturned)

| Discovery | SDK Claim | Reality | Validation |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Input channels | 1 or 3 only | Any count (tested 1-64) | 13/13 HW checks pass |
| FC layers | Independent | Merge into single HW pass (SkipDMA) | 6.7% overhead for 7 extra layers |
| Batch inference | Single sample | Batch=8 → 2.35× throughput | 427μs/sample at batch=8 |
| FC width | ~hundreds | Tested to 8192+ neurons | All map to hardware |
| Multi-output | Not documented | 10 outputs = 4.5% overhead vs 1 | Free cost for physics |
| Weight mutation | Not supported | set_variable() updates without reprogram | Exact linearity (error=0) |
| Power | "30mW" | Board floor 900mW, chip below noise | True inference unmeasurably small |
| Memory | 8MB SRAM | PCIe BAR1 exposes 16GB address space | Full NP mesh addressable |
| Program format | Opaque | FlatBuffer (program_info + program_data) | Weights via DMA, not in program |
| Engine | Simple inference | SkipDMA, on-chip learning, register access | C++ symbol analysis confirmed |

### NPU Validation Suite

| Suite | Checks | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Python hardware (npu_beyond_sdk.py) | 13/13 | All pass on AKD1000 |
| Rust math (validate_npu_beyond_sdk) | 16/16 | All pass (pure math, substrate-independent) |
| Quantization cascade (npu_quantization_parity.py) | 4/4 | f32<0.01%, int8<5%, int4+act4<50% |
| Rust quantization (validate_npu_quantization) | 6/6 | All pass |
| Physics pipeline (npu_physics_pipeline.py) | 10/10 | MD→ESN→NPU→D*,η*,λ* end-to-end |
| Pipeline math (validate_npu_pipeline) | 10/10 | All pass (substrate-independent) |

### Cross-Substrate Math Parity

The same ESN reservoir math is validated on four substrates:

| Substrate | Precision | Error vs f64 | Validated |
|-----------|-----------|:---:|:---:|
| CPU (Rust) | f64 | reference | 16/16 checks |
| NpuSimulator (Rust) | f32 | <0.001% | 6/6 checks |
| Quantized (Rust) | int4 | <30% | 6/6 checks |
| AKD1000 hardware | int4 | measured | 13/13 checks |

This proves the physics is substrate-portable: train on GPU → deploy on NPU.

## Evolution Architecture: Biome → Fungus → Absorption

hotSpring is a biome. ToadStool/barracuda is the fungus — present in every
biome, evolved independently by each. ToadStool at Session 42+ with 612 shaders
(Jacobi fix, f64 compile fixes). The pattern:

```
hotSpring writes local → validates physics → hands off to toadstool → leans on upstream → deletes local
```

### What hotSpring evolved that toadstool absorbed

| Contribution | Type | Upstream Location | Session |
|-------------|------|-------------------|---------|
| Complex f64 arithmetic | WGSL shader | `shaders/math/complex_f64.wgsl` | S18 |
| SU(3) matrix algebra | WGSL shader | `shaders/math/su3.wgsl` | S18 |
| Wilson plaquette | WGSL shader | `shaders/lattice/wilson_plaquette_f64.wgsl` | S18 |
| SU(3) HMC force | WGSL shader | `shaders/lattice/su3_hmc_force_f64.wgsl` | S18 |
| Abelian Higgs HMC | WGSL shader | `shaders/lattice/higgs_u1_hmc_f64.wgsl` | S18 |
| CellList GPU fix | Rust op | `barracuda::ops::md::neighbor` | S18 |
| NAK eigensolve | WGSL shader | `batched_eigh_nak_optimized_f64.wgsl` | S4 |
| ReduceScalar feedback | Pipeline | `barracuda::pipeline` | S18 |
| Driver profiling | System | `barracuda::device::capabilities` | S7 |
| Staggered Dirac GPU | WGSL+Rust | `ops/lattice/dirac.rs` + `shaders/lattice/dirac_staggered_f64.wgsl` | S31d |
| CG solver (3 kernels) | WGSL+Rust | `ops/lattice/cg.rs` + `shaders/lattice/cg_kernels_f64.wgsl` | S31d |
| SubstrateCapability model | Rust enum | `device/substrate.rs` | S31d |
| 5 spherical HFB shaders | WGSL | `shaders/science/hfb/` (density, potentials, energy, hamiltonian) | S36-37 |
| 5 deformed HFB shaders | WGSL | `shaders/science/hfb_deformed/` (energy, potential, wavefunction, hamiltonian, bcs) | S36-37 |
| ESN export/import weights | Rust API | `esn_v2::ESN::export_weights()` + `import_weights()` | S36-37 |
| Spectral module (full) | Rust+WGSL | `barracuda::spectral::*` (Anderson, Lanczos, Hofstadter, Sturm) | S25-31h |

### What hotSpring is evolving now (ready for absorption)

| Module | Shader | Tests | Absorption priority |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| Pseudofermion HMC | CPU (WGSL-ready) | 7/7 | Tier 1 — only remaining lattice QCD module |
| Screened Coulomb eigensolve | CPU (Sturm bisection) | 23/23 | Tier 2 |
| Tolerance/config module | Rust pattern (no WGSL) | 172 constants | Tier 2 (pattern) |

### Loop unroller u32 bug — FIXED

The loop unroller in `loop_unroller.rs` had a u32 literal suffix bug: `substitute_loop_var`
emitted bare ints (`"0"`) instead of `u32` literals (`"0u"`). This caused `BatchedEighGpu`
single-dispatch shader validation to panic. **Fixed** upstream; `catch_unwind` workaround removed.

### Cross-spring shader evolution

ToadStool's barracuda crate benefits from multi-Spring contributions.
See `wateringHole/handoffs/CROSS_SPRING_EVOLUTION_FEB22_2026.md` for the
full map. Key cross-pollination:

- **wetSpring → all**: `(zero + literal)` f64 constant precision fix in `math_f64.wgsl` improved `log_f64` from ~1e-3 to ~1e-15
- **hotSpring → all**: NVK driver workarounds via `ShaderTemplate`, spectral module, eigensolve profiling
- **neuralSpring → hotSpring**: `BatchIprGpu` for GPU Anderson localization diagnostics
- **wetSpring → hotSpring**: `GemmCached` (60× speedup for repeated GEMM) benefits HFB SCF loop

### metalForge Forge: Hardware Discovery

`metalForge/forge/` discovers local hardware via wgpu (same path barracuda uses)
plus local NPU/CPU probing. It finds: 2 GPUs (RTX 4070 + Titan V, both SHADER_F64),
1 NPU (AKD1000), 1 CPU (i9-12900K with AVX2). Dispatch routes workloads by
capability: f64 compute → GPU, quantized inference → NPU, validation → CPU.

biomeGate (Threadripper 3970X, RTX 3090 + Titan V, Akida NPU) is lab-deployable
for extended compute. Node profiles (`metalForge/nodes/biomegate.env`) configure
GPU selection via `HOTSPRING_GPU_ADAPTER`. NVK setup guide at
`metalForge/gpu/nvidia/NVK_SETUP.md` makes Titan V driver installation reproducible.

## GPU FP64 Status (Feb 24, 2026)

Native FP64 GPU compute confirmed on RTX 4070, RTX 3090, and Titan V via `wgpu::Features::SHADER_F64` (Vulkan backend):
- **Precision**: True IEEE 754 double precision (0 ULP error vs CPU f64)
- **Performance**: Consumer Ampere/Ada fp64:fp32 ~1:64 (hardware limit, same as CUDA); Titan V (GV100) provides native 1:2 via 2,560 dedicated FP64 cores. Confirmed by `bench_fp64_ratio` FMA chain micro-benchmark (Feb 24 2026).
- **Implication**: Consumer GPUs provide exact fp64 for correctness; the Titan V (~$500 used) provides compute-class fp64 throughput via the open-source NVK driver
- **Multi-GPU**: RTX 3090/4070 (nvidia proprietary) and Titan V (NVK/nouveau open-source) both produce identical physics to 1e-15
- **Phase C validation**: Full Yukawa MD (9 cases, N=2000, 80k steps) runs at 149-259 steps/s sustained with 0.000% energy drift
- **Phase E validation**: Full paper-parity (9 cases, N=10,000, 80k steps) completes in 3.66 hours with 0.000-0.002% drift. Cell-list 4.1× faster than all-pairs.
- **GPU-only transport pipeline**: `validate_transport_gpu_only` runs full Green-Kubo D*/η*/λ* pipeline on GPU with zero readback (~493s).
- **Unidirectional pipeline**: GPU sum-reduction eliminates per-particle readback — 10,000× bandwidth reduction at N=10,000
- **GPU-resident CG solver**: α, β, rz scalars computed on GPU. 10-iteration batches with 8-byte convergence readback. 15,360× readback reduction (37 MB → 2.4 KB per trajectory).
- **Bidirectional streaming**: 90%+ data to GPU, async readback for CG convergence, NPU branch for phase screening.
- **biomeGate**: RTX 3090 (24GB) extends lattice capacity to 48⁴ dynamical fermion. Node profiles at `metalForge/nodes/`.
