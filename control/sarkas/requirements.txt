# Sarkas MD Control Experiment — Pinned Dependencies
# Python 3.9 required (Numba compatibility)
# Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Used for: Molecular dynamics simulations (DSF, RDF, SSF, VACF)
# that provide training data for the physics EOS surrogate objective.
#
# IMPORTANT: After installing these, also install Sarkas itself:
#   cd sarkas-upstream && pip install -e .
#
# These versions are known-good on Linux x86_64 as of 2026-02-08.
# NOTE: We patched sarkas-upstream for NumPy 2.x / pandas 2.x / Numba 0.60
# compatibility. See hotSpring/CONTROL_EXPERIMENT_STATUS.md for details.
