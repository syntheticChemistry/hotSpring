# CODE OCEAN NOTE: The paper's Code Ocean capsule (10.24433/CO.1152070.v1)
# is gated — sign-up denied on some operating systems. We have fully
# reconstructed the methodology without it. See control/surrogate/REPRODUCE.md.

# The nuclear EOS objective is replaced with a physics EOS derived from
# our validated Sarkas MD simulations (12 cases, 81/81 checks pass).
